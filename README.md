# my-portfolio
Hello! My name is Mayara, and here you will find my personal portfolio. I have developed this responsive project using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Since April 2022, I have been learning and working on full-stack projects although I identify more with back-end development. Now I am seeking my first job in the technology. Hope you like it!

Here I would like to express my sincere thanks and give credit to a big part of this project to @FRONTTEC. I was able to develop this Portfolio with the help of their videos. It was a great inspiration for me and opened up my creativity when giving the final touches to my project!
